This is rastertortl, a driver/filter for Raster Transfer Language Plotters, like the HP DesignJet 600, which I bought off eBay for 1.76dBâ‚¬; I then went and found the files contained in this archive on some obscure mailing list thread, claiming that they were from an early CVS snapshot of CUPS. 

This implies that the source code contained is GPL licensed, so please read about your rights in LICENSE.

The original files of course did not compile with modern cups, and did not come with a Makefile, but with very little tweaks I made them work for me. I now happily print on my 50kg monochrome friend, who conveniently lives in my bedroom. I thus don't claim any copyright, and since all my work consisted of a few lines of commenting out debug prints that were using #defines that no longer exist, I can't claim real contribution. So go wild!

PS: I'm the author of the Makefile. Don't hate me -- things like linker flags are hardcoded, which is because FC 21's cups-devel doesn't even come with a pkg-config file -- and writing a fully fledged CMake detector seemed a bit over the top...

So: Install your CUPS development headers, "make", "sudo make install".

Anyway, following is the original README. Enjoy! ~Marcus
================================================

What is a rtl-printer. 
rtl-printers are older plotter like the hp designjet 600

Who needs this driver?
When you want to use this plotter with cups there is no other free solution

Files:
designjet-pjl.drv - the ppd-source fitting to the cupsddk
designjet600.ppd  - the ppd generated from the cupsddk
rastertortl       - the filter from cups-1.2-CVS
rastertortl.c     - the sourcecode from the filter
readme            - this file



Install:

1. copy rastertortl to your cups-filter directory usuall /usr/lib/cups/filter
2. copy designjet600.ppd to your ppd-directory  /usr/share/cups/model
3. restart cupsd /etc/init.d/cupsd stop; /etc/init.d/cupsd start
4. congfigure the printer
